# Dog vs Cat Image Classifier

This project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images as either a dog or a cat. The model is trained on labeled images and can be used to predict the class of new images.

## Project Overview

- **Model Architecture:** CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers.
- **Input:** Color images resized to 100x100 pixels.
- **Output:** Binary classification — Dog (0) or Cat (1).
- **Framework:** TensorFlow 2.x with Keras API.
- **Model Format:** Saved in `.h5` format for easy loading and inference.
